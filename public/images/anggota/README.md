# Leadership Images Directory

This directory is intended for photos of HMTI's leadership team.

## Image Guidelines
- Images should be named using the person's name in kebab-case (e.g., `ahmad-fauzi.jpg`)
- Recommended image dimensions: 400px Ã— 600px
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Recommended file size: Under 200KB for optimal loading

When you add actual photos, they will automatically be displayed in the leadership section.
Until then, the website will show the first letter of each person's name as a placeholder.
